# MS
Mechanical Physics Simulation

MS standing for Mechanical Simulation

!-- Execution and Utilisation --!
Within a couple of weeks there will be a python script available which will run the modules. For now you need to execute the modules manually by importing them into your python command line.

!! Warning !!
It is still in the early stage and not eady to be executedd jet!

!-- Functions --!

Functions:  x,y,z movement of an object (not implemented)
            x,y,z rotations of an object (not implemented)
            airdrag calculation of an object (not implemented)
            gravitational influence on an object (not implemented)
            multiple object calculation including:  object collisions (not implemented)
                                                    gravitational forces and influences (not implemented)
                                                    magnetic inpluences (not implemented)

-- more functions will be implemented in the future --

A GUI is not planned as i am not good with graphics but if somebody has the time and will to help me at this i will highly appreciate it

!-- Feedback --!

As you probably will be able to see from the code i am not very good at python or programming and i appreciate every help i can get.
Feel free to inform me about any issue i have made or improvement i could make (including english grammar and spelling). Thanks in advance!

!-- How does it work? --!

Its simple there is a class called object which defines and saves all the data of an object. Then there are modules which calculate different physical aspects like movement, rotation, collisions etc.. Finally a function called MPS puts it all together and runs the modules step by step (I havent quite desided in which order).
